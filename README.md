# Croofx

**Croofx is an AI-powered CLI that reviews your repository and tells you what’s broken, why it matters, and how to fix it — in under 60 seconds.**

Built for developers shipping fast with AI who don’t have time for manual debugging.

## ⚡ Why Croofx?

Modern workflows generate a lot of code —  
but understanding and debugging that code is the real bottleneck.

Croofx acts like a **senior engineer in your terminal**:

- Scans your project
- Detects real issues
- Explains the impact
- Suggests ready-to-apply fixes

Before you commit. Before it breaks in production.
