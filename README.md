# Croofx

**Croofx is a repo-aware AI execution engine that runs LLMs on real-world codebases - safely, selectively, and predictably.**

Built for developers who rely on AI daily but don’t want broken patches, wasted tokens, or blind context dumping.

---

## 🚀 Early Access

Croofx is currently in active development - built in public.

If you ship with AI and want structured, controlled execution on serious repositories:

## ⚡ Why Croofx?

Modern AI tools are powerful - but they operate probabilistically.

They:
- Don’t truly understand your full repository
- Lose context across files
- Generate patches that require heavy manual review
- Consume unnecessary tokens
- Occasionally break production

Croofx adds structure around AI.

Instead of blindly sending your entire repo to a model, Croofx:

- Understands your project structure
- Filters out noise (`node_modules`, build folders, env files)
- Selects only high-impact modules
- Validates AI-generated patches before you apply them

**LLMs generate. Croofx enforces discipline.**

## 🧠 V1 Capabilities

Croofx V1 focuses on controlled local execution:

- 📂 Intelligent repository scanning
- 🧭 Language & dependency detection
- 🧠 Context-aware file selection
- 🚨 High-signal issue detection
- 🩹 AI-generated patch suggestions (diff format)
- 🔎 Structured patch validation (syntax & integrity checks)
- 💰 Token-aware execution
- ⚡ CLI-first workflow (~60s runtime target)

---

## 💻 Usage

```bash
cfx analyze
```

Run inside any project folder to:
- Analyze repository structure
- Select relevant context
- Send structured prompts to LLM
- Return validated, patch-ready diffs

## 🎯 V1 Scope

Croofx V1 is intentionally focused:

- Local CLI only
- No auto-modifying files
- No background agents
- No IDE plugin
- No cloud dashboard (yet)

You stay in control.

Croofx analyzes, validates, and suggests - you decide.

## 🏗 What Croofx Is (And Isn’t)
**Croofx is not:**

- A model
- An IDE wrapper
- A chat interface

**Croofx is:**

- A repo-aware execution layer
- A deterministic patch validator
- A token governance system
- A control layer between LLMs and your codebase

## 🏗 Status

- V1 is currently in active development - built in public.
- Follow the journey, test it on your repo, and help shape the first release.

## 🌍 Long-Term Vision

Croofx is the first step toward a structured AI execution platform by Croovi.

As AI becomes central to software development, execution discipline, cost control, and governance will matter more than raw intelligence.

Croofx aims to become the execution layer between LLMs and production systems.
